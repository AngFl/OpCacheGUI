OpCacheGUI
=

GUI for PHP's OpCache. I started this project to see what you can do with PHP's OpCache. There are already a couple of projects who implement something like this, but they are either a "one file to rule them all" or just not very nice looking.

If you are looking for a simple single file status GUI please see [Rasmus' one-page OpCache project][rasmus].

Status

Currently the Opcache status, statistics en cached files are implemented.

Some features that will be implemented soon are:

- Authentication
- Cache invalidation
- Auto refresh
- Shiny graphs

If you would like to see a feature please add [an issue][issues]. If you want to contribute please feel free to send a PR.
